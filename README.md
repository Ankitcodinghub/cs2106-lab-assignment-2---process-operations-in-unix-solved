Important:

‚Äì You must ensure the exercises are implemented in C and work properly on the lab machines (i.e. Linux on x86)

‚Äì Beware of the fork bomb! Do NOT try on sunfire server. A buggy program can easily bring down your account / whole server ÔÅä.

Section 1. Exercises in Lab 2

The purpose of this lab is to learn about process operations in Unix-based OS. There are four exercises in this lab. The first exercise, which is the demo exercise, requires you to try out file manipulation for multiple processes. The remaining three exercises will see you building a simple shell interpreter. Exercises 2, 3, and 4 are described in section 2.

1.1 Exercise 1 [Lab Demo Exercise]

In this exercise, you will use fork()and a few other system calls related to file manipulation to investigate the outcome of multiple processes reading from a file. The following actions should be performed by your program:

1. The program takes in a file name and an integer n as command line arguments

2. Open the file for reading using the system call open

3. Read 1 character from the file using the system call read

4. Create n child processes

5. All processes read from the file one character at a time and print at STDIN using write

6. Each process sleeps for 1ms between read operations (use usleep)

7. Once the end of file is reached, the processes close the file and end their execution (exit)

8. Parent waits for the child processes

9. Repeat steps 2-8 using fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose instead.

Sample Input:

./ex1 file_abc 3 //read file_abc from 3 child processes

Sample Output:

Parent [815]: a

Child 1[818]: b

Parent [815]: c

Child 3[820]: d

Child 2[819]: e //Order among child and parent processes is not fixed Parent: Child 2[819] done.

Parent: Child 1[818] done.

Parent: Child 3[820] done.

Parent [815]: a

Child 1[822]: b

Child 1[822]: c

Child 2[823]: b

Parent [815]: b

Child 3[824]: b

Child 2[823]: c

Child 1[822]: d

Child 3[824]: c

Child 1[822]: e

Child 2[823]: d

Parent [815]: c

Child 3[824]: d

Parent [815]: d

Child 3[824]: e

Parent [815]: e

Child 2[823]: e //Order among child and parent processes is not fixed Parent: Child 2[823] done.

Parent: Child 1[822] done.

Parent: Child 3[824] done.

Parent: Exiting.

Section 2. Command Line Interpreter (Exercise 2 and 3)

A command line interpreter (aka command prompt or shell) allows the execution of multiple user commands with various number of arguments. The user inputs the commands one after another, and the commands are executed by the command line interpreter. You are going to implement an interpreter, named Genie, with various features in the remaining exercises. In exercise 2, Genie will get one simple functionality. You should take the opportunity to plan and design your code since the Genie will be extended in exercise 3.

2.1 Exercise 2 (Basic Genie)

Let us implement a simple working interpreter with limited features in this exercise.

General flow of basic interpreter

1. Prompt for user request.

2. Carry out the user request.

3. Unless user terminates the program, go to step 1.

TWO possible user requests:

1. Quit the interpreter (a.k.a. put Genie back in the bottle). Format: quit

Behavior:

‚Ä¢ Prints message ‚ÄúGoodbye!‚Äù and terminates the interpreter.

2. Run a command (ask your Genie to fulfill a wish). Format: command [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ‚Ä¶]]]

//Read the path of the command and the arguments

//The command is assumed to be less than 19 characters //The arguments are separated by character space.

//Number of arguments is assumed to be less than 10 arguments //Each argument is assumed to be less than 19 characters

Behavior:

a. The command can be a command path or a simple command (such as ls in shell).

b. If the command exists, run the command in a child process

‚Ä¢ Wait until the child process is done

c. Else print error message ‚ÄúXXXX not found‚Äù, where XXXX is the user command.

For 2, you need to check whether a command_path exists (i.e. valid). This can be achieved by various methods, one simple way is to make use of the library call stat(). Find out more about this function by ‚Äúman ‚Äìs2 stat‚Äù. This library function has various usages, but you don‚Äôt need to investigate all of them. Moreover, you don‚Äôt need to have the full knowledge to use this call effectively. [Hint: look carefully at the return type of this function.]

Just like a real shell interpreter, Genie will wait until the command finishes before asking for another user request.

Handling input and output for Genie‚Äôs commands:

‚Ä¢ The standard output of the command (in 2.) must be printed by Genie as standard output.

‚Ä¢ The standard error of the command must be printed by Genie as standard error.

‚Ä¢ No need to support redirecting Genie‚Äôs standard input as the command‚Äôs standard input (commands do not require reading from standard input).

Assumptions:

a. Non-terminating commands will NOT be tested on your interpreter

b. No ctrl-z or ctrl-c will be used during testing. So you do not need to use signal.

c. You can assume user requests are ‚Äúsyntactically correct‚Äù, but the commands might not exist.

You can assume each command and arguments have less than 19 characters. No more than 10 arguments will be provided for a command.

Suggestions on approach:

‚Ä¢ Modularize your code! Try to find the correct code for each of the functionality independently. Test the function thoroughly then work on another part of the program. This allows your code to be reused in exercise 3.

Sample Session:

User Input is shown as bold. Your Genie awaits your command by showing the prompt ‚ÄúGENIE &gt; ‚Äù ÔÅä. Note that additional empty lines are added in between of user inputs to improve readability.

GENIE &gt; /bin/ls //See note*

a.out ex2.c ‚Ä¶ //output from the ‚Äúls‚Äù command

GENIE &gt; ls -al //Use ls from /bin with arguments

GENIE &gt; ps

PID TTY TIME CMD

4 tty1 00:00:00 bash

34 tty1 00:00:00 ps

GENIE &gt; ps -o ppid -o pid //Use ps with arguments

PPID PID

3 4

4 37

GENIE &gt; ps-l

/bin/ps-l not found // ‚Äúps-l‚Äù does not exist

GENIE &gt; quit

Goodbye! // Interpreter exits

‚Äúwhereis ls‚Äù to find out the correct path for your system.

2.2 Exercise 3 (Advanced Genie)

This exercise extends the capabilities of the interpreter from exercise 2. Genie is enhanced as shown below:

Possible user requests:

1. [No change] Quit the interpreter. Format: quit //No change from ex2.

2. [No change] Run a command (ask your Genie to fulfill a wish). Format: command [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] ‚Ä¶ //No change from ex2.

3. [NEW] Pipe between two commands. Format:

command1 [arg1 to arg10] | command2 [arg1 to arg10]

Behavior:

a. If the specified commands exist, run the commands in child processes with the supplied command line arguments.

c. The interpreter will

‚Ä¢ Wait until the child processes are done.

d. If any of the commands do not exist, print error message ‚ÄúXXXX not found‚Äù, where XXXX is the user entered command.

e. Note that this is a subset of the case with pipes among multiple commands

(point 4)

4. [NEW] Pipes among multiple commands. Format:

command1 [arg1 to arg10] | command2 [arg1 to arg10] | command3 [arg1 to arg10] | command4 [arg1 to arg10]

| command5 [arg1 to arg10] ‚Ä¶

Behavior:

a. If all specified commands exist, run the commands in child processes with the supplied command line arguments. There will be at most 10 chained jobs in a command.

b. For a chain of jobs, for each pipe (‚Äú|‚Äù), the output of the job before the pipe is input for job the after the pipe.

c. The interpreter will

‚Ä¢ Wait until the child processes are done.

d. If any of the commands does not exist, print error message ‚ÄúXXXX not found‚Äù, where XXXX is the user entered command. No other jobs should be executed.

Assumptions:

a. Non-terminating command will NOT be tested on your interpreter.

b. No ctrl-z or ctrl-c will be used during testing.

c. Each command line argument has less than 19 characters.

d. There are at most 10 command line arguments for each job (commands)

e. There are at most 10 chained jobs in a command.

d. You can assume all user requests are ‚Äúsyntactically correct‚Äù, but the commands might not exist.

Notes:

o Remember to use the wait() system call in exercise 2.

Suggestions on approach:

o This exercise is challenging. Again, implementing the required functionalities incrementally is the best approach.

C. Don‚Äôt be demoralized. ÔÅä]

Sample Session:

User Input is shown as bold.

GENIE &gt; /bin/ls -al //list files in the current folder total 32 //output from the ‚Äúls‚Äù command drwxrwxr-x 2 ccris ccris 4096 Sep 3 15:51 . drwxrwxr-x 3 ccris ccris 4096 Aug 31 12:42 .. -rw-rw-r‚Äì 1 ccris ccris 55 Sep 3 15:51 file

-rwxrwxr-x 1 ccris ccris 9208 Aug 31 11:09 filefork

-rw-rw-r‚Äì 1 ccris ccris 823 Aug 31 11:09 filefork.c -rw-rw-r‚Äì 1 ccris ccris 534 Aug 31 12:34 genie.c

GENIE &gt; cat filename |tail ‚Äìn 1 //list last line of

//content from filename

JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ //output

GENIE &gt; cat file | grep a //search for lines that contain

//‚Äúa‚Äù in ‚Äúfile‚Äù

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv

GENIE &gt; ls ‚Äìal | head ‚Äì2 //list first two lines from

//the output of ls -al total 32 drwxrwxr-x 2 ccris ccris 4096 Sep 3 15:51 .

GENIE&gt; ls | cat -n | wc ‚Äìw //list the files, print their

//names preceded by index, and count the words

8

GENIE &gt; ls -l | wc -l | echo ‚ÄúGenie is here‚Äù

Genie is here

GENIE&gt; quit

Goodbye! // Interpreter exits

2.3. Exercise 4 (Enhanced Genie)

Your Genie needs to remember some things now. In your advanced Genie (Exercise 3), implement support for setting, using and unsetting of environment variables as follows:

‚Ä¢ An environment variable is set using the special command ‚Äúset‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ To unset it, you must support the special command ‚Äúunset‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ You must support evaluating the value of an environment variable, when it is passed as an argument to a command, prefixed by the special character ‚Äò$‚Äô.

‚Ä¢ The environment variables are local to your interpreter, and until unset, can be used by any command executed by your shell.

Additional user requests:

1. [NEW] Set an environment variable: set NAME value

Behavior:

Sets environment variable NAME to value value.

2. [NEW] Unset an environment variable: unset $NAME

Behavior:

Unsets the value for variable NAME

3. [NEW] Use an environment variable in any command:

$NAME

Behaviour:

A variable can be used in any command in the interpreter using its name prefixed by $. The variable is replaced by its value. Assume that $ is not used by any other command.

User Input is shown as bold.

GENIE &gt; set ENV1 filename //set the environment variable

//ENV1 to be ‚Äúfilename‚Äù

GENIE &gt; echo $ENV1 //print ENV1 filename

GENIE &gt; cat $ENV1 |tail ‚Äìn 1 //list last line of

//content from filename

JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ //output

GENIE &gt; unset $ENV1 //unset $ENV1

GENIE &gt; echo $ENV1 //print ENV1

//no output

GENIE&gt; quit

Goodbye! // Interpreter exits
